        <h2>Frontend Development</h2>
        <p>Frontend development is the part of web development that focuses on the visual side of a website — what users see and interact with directly in their browser.

    <section id="backend">
        <h2>Backend Development</h2>
        <p>Backend development is the part of web development that works behind the scenes — <br>
            it’s everything that happens on the server side to make a website function properly. 
            Users don’t see this part directly, but it powers the features they interact with on the frontend.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Fullstack">
        <h2>Fullstack Development</h2>
        <p>Full-stack development means working on both the frontend and the backend of a website or web application. 
            A full-stack developer is someone who can build the entire system —<br> 
            from what the user sees in the browser to how the server and database handle data in the background.
